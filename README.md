# INTRODUCTION
The purpose of this instruction manual is to introduce the basic concepts of creating SolidWorks drawings. With a user-friendly interface, cutting-edge features, and seamless integration with other tools and applications, SolidWorks enables designers and engineers to bring their ideas to life with unparalleled accuracy and efficiency. Whether you're a seasoned professional or a student learning the ropes of CAD design, SolidWorks is an ideal choice for transforming your concepts into reality.
# Getting started
This instruction will:
* Introduce main concepts of SolidWorks Drawings
* Explain how to create Drawing part, choose custom sheet size
* Demonstrate the single design component from different views (front, bottom, right, left, section and other views)
* Add dimensions on the scheme
Prerequisites:
* Make sure you have [SolidWorks](https://www.solidworks.com/support/community-download#no-back) installed with drawings creation ability. Version 2021 or higher is required
* Have an understanding of using and creating SolidWorks part file
* You can use the [example](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1s6IYy6kvwLmyibqGsZ2YoUXnnX7jKRGC?usp=sharing) of the part file used in this tutorial for the practice.

Definitions/Terms used:
* Drawing document/sheet
* Dimensions
* Drawing views: standart orientations, section, projected, detailed, etc

# Instructions step-by-step
**Step 1.** Launch SolidWorks on your computer and create or select a part file you intend to make a drawing on or you can use the provided example.

**Step 2.** After you have opened your part file, navigate to the “File” toolbar and select the “Make Drawing from Part” option.

**Step 3. Custom sheet size**  
Choose the desired sheet size and orientation. In case the desired sheet size is not available, you can select the “Custom sheet size” option to create your own sheet with personalized parameters.

**Step 4. Adding views**  
Use the "View palette" tool on the right-hand of the screen to add the desired part views. There are many distinct view types available, including _front_, _back_, _top_ and _isometric views_.

>In case you want to show your part file from other views, you can use _section_, _broken-out_ and _crop views_. The instructions for such view types are provided below.  

a) Select a “Section View” function in the “Drawing” tool to make a half section view of the part. Drag the section view to its place.

</p>  

b) Broken-out  
Select a “Broken-out Section” option in the “Drawing” tool. Circle the required area of the view by putting dots on the drawing sheet and joining them as shown below. Specify the depth of the cut and click OK.

</p>  

c) Crop view  
Sketch the area of the part that you want to preserve, the rest will be cut out. Then select a “Crop view” option in “Drawing” tool.

</p>  

**Step 5. Adding Dimensions and Annotations to the Drawing**  
To add all the dimensions of the drawing, select the “Model Items” option in the “Annotations” tool. Then, choose the parts and click OK. Program will assign dimensions automatically.

In order to add specific dimensions manually, click on the “Smart Dimensions” tool. You can select the type of dimension you want to add, such as linear or angular, and then click on the points you want to measure. For example, displaying the radius of the selected part.

</p>  

**Step 6. Edit sheet format**
Use the "Edit sheet format" tool to add notes and labels to the drawing.

After properly positioning the view and arranging dimensions, your drawing is ready.
